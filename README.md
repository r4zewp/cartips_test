# CarTips test

## Packages used
bottom_navy_bar package is used to create specified bottom navigation bar

## Time spent
Approximately 6 hours were spent

## Notes
1) It was not clear if mock data for buttons is enough. For a second I thought that I should create API providing all that data. 

2) QR-code names appear to be user input, so it can be written in any language. That's why
there's no localization for it.
